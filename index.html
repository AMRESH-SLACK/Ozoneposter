            <p>The ozone layer is one layer of the stratosphere, the second layer of the Earth’s atmosphere. <br> The
                stratosphere is the mass of protective gases clinging to our planet.
                The stratosphere gets <br> its name because it is stratified, or layered: as elevation increases, the
                stratosphere gets warmer. <br> The stratosphere increases in warmth with elevation because ozone gases
                in
                the
                upper layers <br> absorb intense ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
                Ozone is only a trace gas in the atmosphere — <br> only about 3 molecules for every 10 million molecules
                of
                air.
                But it does a very important job. <br> Like a sponge, the ozone layer absorbs bits of radiation hitting
                Earth
                from the sun. Even though <br> we need some of the sun's radiation to live, too much of it can damage
                living
                things. <br> The ozone layer acts as a shield for life on Earth.</p>

            <p>It turns out that certain types of molecules can cause a chemical reaction when they come in contact with
                ozone molecules. <br> This causes the ozone to break up and become unable to absorb ultraviolet light.
                The
                main
                molecules that are destroying the <br> ozone layer are called chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs.
                Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
                Chlorofluorocarbons are a group of chemicals <br> which are made up of only chlorine, fluorine, carbon,
                and
                hydrogen. They were first used as refrigerants to keep things cold. A <br> lot of people considered CFCs
                miracle
                chemicals. Eventually they were used in a variety of products including air conditioners, <br> spray
                cans,
                fire
                extinguishers, and in manufacturing foams.
                Unfortunately, CFCs can eventually find their way into the Earth's <br> atmosphere and the ozone layer.
                Once
                they
                get there they destroy ozone molecules and cause the ozone layer to become depleted or thinner.</p>

                <p>Avoid the consumption of gases dangerous to the ozone layer, <br> due to their content or
                    manufacturing
                    process. Some of the <br> most dangerous gases are CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), <br> halogenated
                    hydrocarbon,
                    methyl bromide and nitrous oxide.</p>

            <li class="second">
                <p>Minimize the use of cars. The best transport option is urban, bicycle, <br> or walking. If you use a
                    car
                    to a destination, try to carpool with others <br> to decrease the use of cars in order to
                    pollute
                    less
                    and save.</p>

            <li class="third">
                <p>Do not use cleaning products that are harmful to the environment <br> and to us. Many cleaning
                    products
                    contain solvents and substances <br> corrosive, but you can replace these dangerous substances with
                    non <br> -toxic products such as vinegar or bicarbonate.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="fourth">
                <p>Buy local products. In this way, you not only get fresh products <br> but you avoid consuming food
                    that
                    has traveled long distances. <br> As the more distance traveled, the more nitrous oxide is produced
                    <br>
                    due
                    to the medium used to transport that product.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="fifth">
                <p>Maintain air conditioners, as their malfunctions <br> cause CFC to escape into the
                    atmosphere.</p>
